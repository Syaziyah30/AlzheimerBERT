# AlzheimerBERT

AlzheimerNER is an advanced text mining project that focuses on analyzing clinical trial eligibility criteria for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, this project aims to unlock valuable insights from unstructured clinical text.

At the core of AlzheimerNER is a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built using the BERT architecture, specifically tailored for biomedical and clinical language. By integrating the transformers and bert packages, the model accurately extracts and classifies complex semantic entities such as diagnoses, treatments, biomarkers, conditions, and patient characteristics from raw eligibility criteria.
