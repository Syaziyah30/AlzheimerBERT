# AlzheimerBERT

AlzheimerNER is a specialized text mining project that analyzes clinical trial eligibility criteria for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It harnesses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to transform complex, unstructured clinical language into structured, meaningful data.

At its core, the project features a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically fine-tuned for biomedical and clinical contexts. Leveraging the transformers and bert packages, the model accurately extracts and classifies critical clinical entities such as:

ðŸ©º Diagnoses

ðŸ’Š Treatments and Medications

ðŸ§ª Biomarkers

ðŸ§¬ Medical Conditions

ðŸ‘¤ Patient Characteristics

This project empowers researchers to extract actionable insights from free-text eligibility criteria, supporting better study design, patient recruitment, and analysis in Alzheimerâ€™s research.
