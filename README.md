# AlzheimerBERT

AlzheimerNER is a text mining project focused on the clinical trial eligibility criteria for Alzheimer's disease. This project integrates machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques using BERT package in python to develop a model capable of extracting and classifying semantic concepts and entities from unstructured free-text criteria. The goal is to transform complex clinical language into structured insights that support research, recruitment, and analysis in Alzheimer's studies.
