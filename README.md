#AzheimerNER

AlzheimerNER is a specialized text mining project that analyzes clinical trial eligibility criteria for Alzheimerâ€™s disease. It harnesses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to transform complex, unstructured clinical language into structured and meaningful data.

At its core, the project features a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model built using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically fine-tuned for clinical contexts. It leverages the transformers and bert packages, along with a domain-specific dictionary that enhances entity recognition by capturing specialized terms and patterns that may not be covered by the model alone. The semantic classifications involved include:

ðŸ©º Diagnoses
ðŸ’Š Treatments and Medications
ðŸ§ª Biomarkers
ðŸ§¬ Medical Conditions
ðŸ‘¤ Patient Demographic

This project empowers researchers to extract actionable insights from free-text eligibility criteria, supporting improved study design, patient recruitment, and analysis in Alzheimerâ€™s research.
