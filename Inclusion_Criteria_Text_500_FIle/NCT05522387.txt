apply:~1. Participated and completed the full duration of the study intervention and all procedures at the End

and/or behavior symptoms which were ongoing during the double-blind study should remain at a constant dose
throughout this study.~3. Patient must be willing and able to provide informed consent prior to any study

informant assessments are performed. This study partner should agree to monitor and report on concomitant
medications, understand the study requirements, and assist the participant in meeting study requirements.
Patients with study partners that do not meet this criterion but are determined by the investigator as able to
provide an adequate assessment of the patient may also participate with prior approval from the sponsor
