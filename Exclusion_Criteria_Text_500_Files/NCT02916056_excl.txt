Exclusion Criteria:~* The subject is felt by the investigator to be unsuitable (on the basis of health,
compliance, caregiver availability, or for any other reason) for inclusion in the study.~* Subjects with
serious suicide risk. If there are yes answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C-SSRS, a
suicide risk assessment must be done by a qualified mental health professional with expertise in the evaluation
of suicidality in the elderly (e.g., psychiatrist, geriatrician or neurologist specializing in treatment of
patients with AD) to determine whether it is safe for the subject to participate in the study.~* Subjects
demonstrating a QTcF > 480 msec or a >45 msec change from the TTP488-301 Baseline value based on the locally
read ECG performed at the TTP488-301 Month 18 Visit (TTP488-303 Baseline). Participants with known history of
bundle branch block (either right or left) are allowed if absolute QTcF value does not exceed 500 msec.
Participants with a functioning pacemaker, indicated by an ECG displaying paced rhythm, are allowed with no QTc
upper limit.~* Other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may
increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may prevent
the subject from completing the 2-year study or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in
the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.
