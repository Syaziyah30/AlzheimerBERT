Exclusion Criteria:~* Brain MRI (or CT) scan suggestive of clinically significant structural CNS disease
confirmed by central read (e.g. cerebral large-vessel disease \[large vessel (cortical) infarcts greater than
10 mm in diameter\], prior macro-haemorrhage \[greater than 1 cm\^3\], cerebral vascular malformations,
cortical hemosiderosis, intracranial aneurism(s), intracranial tumours, changes suggestive of normal pressure
hydrocephalus).~* Brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) (or CT) scan suggestive of significant small vessel
pathology confirmed by central read and defined as greater than1 lacunar infarct and/or ARWMC (age-related
white matter changes) greater than 2, (WM (white matter) greater than 20 mm) in the deep white matter and
periventricular regions.~* Brain MRI (or CT) scan suggestive of strategic infarcts defined as bilateral
thalamic lacunar infarcts and singular paramedian thalamic infarcts confirmed by central read.~* Evidence of a
relevant neurological disorder other than MCI or mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type at screening, including
but not limited to Parkinson's disease, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal dementia of any type, Huntington's
disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive
supranuclear palsy, neurosyphilis, HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), learning disability, intellectual
disability, hypoxic cerebral damage, or significant head trauma with loss of consciousness that led to
persistent cognitive deficits~* Evidence of a clinically relevant or unstable psychiatric disorder, based on
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria, including schizophrenia or other
psychotic disorder, or bipolar disorder. A subject with a history of major depression who has not had an
episode in the last 24 months before the day of screening and is considered in remission or whose depression is
controlled with treatment can be included in the trial per investigator's judgement.
